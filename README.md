# Compound Calculator

To benchmark the accuracy of my calculations, I have used [this compound calculator](https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php) that is available online to create my scenarios for my tests.

The formulas used are identical to the one of said compound calculator, which are described in detail on [this page](https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/articles/finance/compound-interest-formula.php).

An example of the formulas are:

## User Stories / Version iterations

Version 1 As a user, when I give: a) my current value, b) my monthly input and c) the amount of years I want it to compound it gives me an expected new value after these years. I assume the compound interest value is the same and is hardcoded to 7%.

I only receive the new value, and do not care what percentage of it is compounded.

Version 2 As a user, when I give the same input I want to know at the end of those years how much of it is compounded. I only get the result of my expected value at the end.

Version 3 As a user, I want to see the breakdown of how much my value is each year within the given years. I also want to see how much of that value is compounded.

Version 4 As a user, I want to have the ability to choose my compound interest value.

Version 5 As a user, I want to have the ability to have multiple compound interest values, distributed over different percentages of my money.
